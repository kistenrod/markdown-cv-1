### Personal summary

> Hello! I was born in Palmeira dos Índios/AL. I moved to Maceió/AL in 2015 to go to college. Since I knew how to program (just in Pascal and Java by that time), I get my first "job" on my first month at college. After that, I get a intership and right after I get my first remote job at an american startup.
> I'm living in São Paulo since July.
> My current interests are about learn and improve my skills of Funcional Programming (unfortunately, I never had a 'production' experience with this) and architecture stuff, mainly on how we can develop huge platforms that can comunicate asyncronously stable and without losing data. I have experience working with HTML-CSS-JS things, despite I'm not focusing on that right now, I'm always reading articles and improving this skills too :)
