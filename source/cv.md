### Personal summary

> Hello! I'm a Software Engineer that lives in São Paulo since July 2017. My current interests are on the microsservices architecture, Functional Programming and GraphQL. I had experience with front-end stuff with React Native on my current job and React on my previous one, but these are not my focus at the moment.

### Employment 

- dez/2017 - now: Software Engineer, Nubank

> Nubank is the biggest digital bank outside Asia and helped to build the personal loans product, I joined the team at the beginning and could participate on the architecture and design of the flows, along with the development of microsservices with Clojure + Kafka + GraphQL and the app built on React Native + Apollo. The project is running in production since january and we are currently improving the flows based on customer's feedbacks and re-designing the initial architecture to be able to support another types of loans.
> I also contribute to the hiring guild, doing structured interviews, evaluating technical exercises and helping to create a structured way to evaluate the candidate's cv (where the main goal was to eliminate bias).

- jan/2017 - dez/2017: Software Engineer, Bionexo

> Bionexo is a marketplace for hospitals and their suppliers, and I helped to create their new platform, using Ruby on Rails and React. My biggest challenge was to develop on top of many platforms that they have, since many things are asynchronous (with the help of AWS SNS/SQS and Sidekiq) and also I'm working with (not an expert, I just had a brief contact) with Redis, ElasticSearch.

- nov/2016 - mar/2018: Freelancer Software Developer, Testr - remote

> Worked in a project with Django and another using React.

- dez/2015 - set/2016: Quality Assurance Developer, Tidy - Costa Mesa/CA - remote

> My goal at Tidy was to develop an automated e2e pipeline that checks if the platform works as they needed. My automation tools included Cucuber, Selenium, Docker and Ruby.
